# PiHole Configs


## Blocklist
Currently only my [PiHole blocklist](/blocklist.txt) is available which you can configure under the [PiHole blocklist setting page](http://pi.hole/admin/settings.php?tab=blocklists).

It includes all the lists from [https://firebog.net/](https://firebog.net/).

With this you may add a lot of websites to your whitelist.
